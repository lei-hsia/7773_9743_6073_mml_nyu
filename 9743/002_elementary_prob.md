#### theme: set theory

1. Cartesian product: cross product;

2. <b> point mass function </b>: xxxxx, 
```point mass function can be used interchangably with probability```

3. . A randon variable is a function, X from a probability space S to the real numbers,
that is, ```X: S -> R```.

4. In the ```Random Variables``` section, the notation is much neater than previous ``set``` section.

5. attention: 
  - example: Independence without uniformity
  - example: Pairwise independence without Triplet-wise independence
  
6. ** topic of this course is Markov chains, the earliest mathematical divergence from independence.**
So, Markov Chain is the earliest mathematical divergence from independence.
