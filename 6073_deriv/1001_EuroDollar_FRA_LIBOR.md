Metallgesellschaft Risks: 

1. Basis risk: hedging is not perfect: hedging crude oil with gasoline.

2. Credit risk: OTC with dealer, not clearinghouse.

3. Rollover risk: hedging duration is too long: no available on-the-market instruments. Rollover might fail, cannot EXACTLY match what they originally.

4. Funding risk: futures mark-to-margin may not be covered.

5. Model risk: the whole strategy might not be good.

6. Impact risk: MG's trade is too large

7. Liquid risk: related to 6.

8. Accounting risk: cash flow on balance sheet, etc. recorded differently in Germany and US.

9. Bona fide risks: counterparty is not bona fide, which added to your risks.

Strip Hedge: use a strip of future contracts, each with a different delivery date.

Stack Hedge: use a stack hedge, in which the most nearby and liquid contract is used, and it is rolled over to the next-to-nearest contract as time passes.

MG: entered into stack and roll hedge because the long term futures in oil were very illiquid.
