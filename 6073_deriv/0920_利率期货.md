Interest Rate Futures: 

foreword: So far we have covered futures contracts on commodities, stock indices, and foreign currencies. 

This chapter:: Theasury bond && Enrodollar futures contracts traded in the US. Many of the other
interest rate futures contracts throughout the world have been modeled on these contracts.

#### 1. Day Count and Quotation conventions

  a. Why it's important: The day count defines the way in which interest accrues over time.
  
  b. Price Quotations of U.S. ```Treasury Bills```: price of money market: quoted using a discount rate
     This is the interest earned as a percentage of the FINAL FACE VALUE rather than as a 
     percentage of the INITIAL price paid for the instrument.
  
  c. Price Quotations of U.S. ```Treasury Bonds```: 32s quoted.

#### 4. Conversion factors
As mentioned, the Treasury bond futures contact allows the party with the ```short position```
to choose to deliver any bond that has a maturity between 15 && 25 years. 

The cash received for each $100 face value of the bond delivered is :

Most recent settlement price * Conversion factor + Accrued interest

e.g. 
most recent settlement price is 120-00
conversion factor for the bond delivered: 1.3800
accrued interest on this bond at time of delivery: $3/$100 face value;
=> 
Cash received by the party w. the short position is: (1.38*120.00)+3 = $168.60
```
**each contract is for the delivery of ```$100,000``` face value of bonds**.

#### 5. Cheapest-to-deliver Bond

At any given time during the delivery month, there're many bonds that can be delivered in
the Treasur bond futures market. **The party with the short position** can choose which 
of the available bonds is cheapest to deliver.
