final project: 

Course Project 6: Analysis of causal relations and information propagation between stocks
• Data: S&P500 intraday stock data

• Objective: Build a model of causal relationship between stock price changes. Use the results
to cluster stocks in groups which would have their leaders and laggards.

What I did:
clustering US stocks in PCA, then use Transfer Entropy to analyze causal relationships.
