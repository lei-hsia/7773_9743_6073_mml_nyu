In theory: ANY non-linear function can be modeled by NN with TWO hidden layers;

ANY function with JUMP, SPIKE, or sudden vanishes, can be modeled by NN with THREE hidden layers

RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks) /LSTM(Long-short term memory) networks:
RNN: often used in autocorrelated variables, e.g. time series
